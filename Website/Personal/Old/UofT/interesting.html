<h3><u>A Meaningful Little story:</u></h3><p>
One day a farmer's donkey fell down into a well. The animal cried piteously for hours 
as the farmer tried to figure out what to do. Finally he decided the animal was too 
old and the well needed to be covered up anyway, it just wasn't worth it to retrieve 
the donkey.  He invited all his neighbours to come over and help him. They all grabbed 
a shovel and began to shovel dirt into the well. At first, the donkey realized what 
was happening and cried horribly.  Then, to everyone's amazement, he quieted down. A
few shovel loads later, the farmer finally looked down the well and was astonished 
at what he saw.  With every shovel of dirt that hit his back, the donkey was doing 
something amazing.  He would shake it off and take a step up.  As the farmer's neighbours 
continued to shovel dirt on top of the animal, he would shake it off and take a step up.  
Pretty soon, everyone was amazed as the donkey stepped up over the edge of the well and 
trotted off!<p>
Life is going to shovel dirt on you, all kinds of dirt.  The trick to getting out of the 
well is to shake it off and take a step up.  Each of our troubles is a stepping stone.  
We can get out of the deepest wells just by not stopping, never giving up! Shake it off 
and take a step up!<p>
